# Benefits of using nested models -

# Better organization of related data (e.g., vitals, address, insurance)
# Reusability: Use Vitals in multiple models (e.g., Patient, MedicalRecord)
# Readability: Easier for developers and API consumers to understand
# Validation: Nested models are validated automaticallyâ€”no extra work needed
